4. MOC → GSB → MHRSD: Verify labor quota
5. MOC → GSB → Municipality: Check zoning approval
6. MOC: Issue license (3 minutes total)
```

**GSB Technical Specs**:
- Protocol: REST APIs (JSON)
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + mTLS
- Message queue: Apache Kafka
- Average latency: 150ms per call
- Throughput: 10,000 TPS
